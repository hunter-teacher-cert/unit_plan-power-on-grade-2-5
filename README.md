# LET'S POWER ON EQUITY FOR CS
by Ashley Ufret and Th√©a Williams

-----

### General Overview
(include here description of unit, what class(es) it fits into, when...)
- Description: The Power On book will be read aloud to students in chunks of one chapter at a time. Teachers will revisit the lessons to teach reading strategies and have students discuss the text. Topics discussed will be connected and weaved into writing unit prompts that have cross-over connections. Students will create computer science PSA projects in Scratch or Code.org to spread awareness about CS representation, using an equity theme, from the text they connect with, as guideline for their project. 
- When: Will be taught during SEL period (periods of time dedicated to social-emotional learning), Science/Computer Science period and ELA(reading/writing) periods. 
- Grades: 2-5

### Motivation for Unit
(why have you decided to make this?)
This unit will offer students explicit access to the social justice issue of inequitable representation of minorities in computer science fields. Another motivation is to create elementary level resources to make the Power On graphic novel accessible to younger students. The graphic novel format and ELA integration will serve as an entry point to helping students understand these sophisticated topics and concepts. We believe these real-world issues will empower student voice and shape change-makers/social justice activists.
